In this backend project, I've  used Node, Express, Mongoose, Typescript.
I used zod for validation. I also added eslint and prettier for formating. 
You can run the project localy using postman. I've used PORT=5000 and the Endpoint: /api/products for the products section as well ass /api/orders for order section.
