In this backend project, I've  used Node, Express, Mongoose, and Typescript.
I used Zod for validation. I also added eslint and prettier for formatting. 
You can run the project locally using postman. I've used PORT=5000 and the Endpoint: /api/products for the products section as well as /api/orders for the order section.
